Basic API connexion app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Nice to remember:
* directory structure: containers vs components
* using `NODE_PATH=src:src/components:src/containers react-scripts start` as `npm start` allows to shortcut directly to the container and component folders
* To display component from array, map over it and return the results (requires key)
